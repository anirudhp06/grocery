Billing of Grocery,
I have created this program to print the grocery bils
this programs shows you your total outstanding bill and also fills it up in a local file to calculate at the end of your business day.
This is simple python script.
If you have any doubts about this program please do contact me, my reddit username is u/anirudhp06.



This program outputs/creates a local file with name of current date and time at the time of executing the program, the file will be created in location where ur python file is present.
